# Specific print customizations

## Add print margins to the document

When the LaTeX file has been generated, you can add a print margin with the length `printmargin` in the TEX file. This length squeezes the logo, the title, the version number in the header, and the link in the footer to allow a full-size print when the printer automatically crops the edges of the printing area.

A good print margin guess is 0.4 cm.
