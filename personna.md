## Alphonse

Nuclear physicist with limited programming knowledges, he has been using Fortran for thirty years to implement mathematical and physical models.

He has to use Kokkos for his three-dimensional code to run on GPU, and will likely hire some help for this task.

## Béatrice

CFD programmer in the industry, she has been using Kokkos for one year on two different projects that run on CPU and GPU.

She wants to code with Kokkos efficiently without getting lost in the documentation.

## Christophe

Former CUDA developper for six years, he is specialized in GPU code tuning.

He wants to transition to Kokkos to target other GPUs without having to learn their specific language.

## Dolorès

Undergraduate student in computer sciences, she knows GPU programming, machine learning, and various modern stacks.

She wants to learn Kokkos for her six-month long internship on GPU computing.

## Estéban

Mid-career physicist who has worked on solvers development for fifteen years, he has a couple of years of experience in Kokkos too.

He wants to rewrite an existing code from scratch using Kokkos and make it as clean and portable as possible.

## Félicie

System engineer who manages several clusters and helps the CI of various projects.

She wants to deploy Kokkos for cluster users and for CI workflows.
